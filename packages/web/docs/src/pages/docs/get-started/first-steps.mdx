# First Steps with Hive Cloud

<Steps>

### Create Hive Account

To get started with Hive, first sign up and create your Hive account if you haven't already.
[You can use this page to login or sign up](https://app.graphql-hive.com/auth).

<NextImage
  alt="Login/Signup view"
  src={signupImage}
  className="mt-10 max-w-sm rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

<Callout type="info">
  At the moment, Hive Cloud supports GitHub and Google authentication, or you can use a plain
  email/password combination.
</Callout>

Once you have your Hive account, you can create your Hive organization.

### Create Hive Organization

A Hive organization is a group of users who share a common set of permissions, or who collaborate on
GraphQL APIs. Hive organizations are used to manage access, integrations, and billing.

To create a new organization, [you use this page](https://app.graphql-hive.com/org/new).

<NextImage
  alt="Create Organization Form"
  src={orgImage}
  className="mt-10 max-w-lg rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

Once you've successfully created your organization, you'll be able to expand your organization by
inviting other members to join and collaborate on projects.

<Callout type="info">

You can create as many organizations as you want, and you can be a member of multiple organizations.

</Callout>

### Install Hive CLI

Hive CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to manage your GraphQL schemas terminal.

#### NodeJS

If you are running a JavaScript/NodeJS project, you can install Hive CLI from the `npm` registry:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i -D @graphql-hive/cli
```

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend installing Hive CLI as part of your project, under `devDependencies`, instead of
  using a global installation.
</Callout>

#### Binary

If you are running a non-JavaScript project, you can download the prebuilt binary of Hive CLI using
the following command:

```bash
curl -sSL https://graphql-hive.com/install.sh | sh
```

To download a specific version, follow instructions from the
["Hive CLI installation"](/docs/api-reference/cli#specific-version) chapter.

### Create Hive Project

A Hive **project** represents a GraphQL API project running a GraphQL schema, created under an
organization.

Within a Hive **project**, you can create **targets** (which are equivalent to runtime environments)
and manage different schemas across different contextual runtimes.

Hive supports the following project types:

- **Single Schema**: a GraphQL project that has a single GraphQL schema developed as a standalone.
- **Schema Stitching**: a form of remote schema merging allowing developers to merge any GraphQL
  schema(s), under one or many gateways. You can use either direct
  [Schema Stitching](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/stitching) or
  [GraphQL Mesh](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/mesh) for this project type.
- **Apollo Federation**: a form of remote schema merging developed according to the
  [Federation specification](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/subgraph-spec/).

<Callout>
  Please note that a **project** type cannot be changed once it is created. However, you can always
  create an unlimited number of projects under your organization.
</Callout>

To get started with your Hive **project**, click on **Create Project +** button from the
organization's main page:

<NextImage
  alt="Create Project Form"
  src={projectImage}
  className="mt-10 max-w-lg rounded-lg drop-shadow-md"
/>

Once you have your project created, you should notice that 3 **targets** are automatically created
for you: `development`, `staging` and `production`. These are just defaults, and you can feel free
to change/delete them as you see fit.

The following guides will help you to get started with your Hive **project**, depending on the type
of project you selected:
